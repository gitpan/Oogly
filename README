Oogly - A Data validation idea that just might be ideal!

Oogly is a different approach to data validation, it attempts to simplify and
centralize data validation rules to ensure DRY (don't repeat yourself) code.
PLEASE NOTE! It is not the intent of this module to provide validation routines
but instead to provide simplistic validation flow-control, and promote code
reuse. I suppose it could be considered a data validation framework.

The following is an example of that...

    use MyApp::Validation;
    my $app = MyApp::Validation->new(\%params);
    if ($app->validate('login', 'password')){
        ...
    }

    package MyApp::Validation
    use Oogly;

    # define a mixin, a sortof template that can be included with other rules
    # by using the mixin directive
    mixin 'default' => {
        required    => 1,
        min_length  => 4,
        max_length  => 255
    };

    # define a data validation rule for parameter `login` using the default
    # mixin where the `login` must be between 4-255 characters long and have
    # at least one letter and number
    field 'login' => {
        label => 'user login',
        mixin => 'default',
        validation => sub {
            my ($self, $this, $params) = @_;
            my ($name, $value) = ($this->{name}, $this->{value});
            $self->error($this, "field $name must contain at least one letter and number")
                if ($value !~ /[a-zA-Z]/ && $value !~ /[0-9]/);
        }
    };

    # define a data validation rule for parameter `password` using the
    # previously defined field `login` as the mixin (template)
    field 'password' => {
        mixin_field => 'login',
        label => 'user password'
    };
